Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element

element, element
element1 element2 (element2 inside of element1)
element > element
element1 + element2 (element2 exactly *after* element1)

A > B will only select B that are direct children to A (that is, there are no other elements inbetween).

A B will select any B that are inside A, even if there are other elements between them.

for "+":

Select and style the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements:

div + p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)

-Importance
-Source Order
